## Mini lib for Capybara and poltergeist

### Here is task:

* Write a crawler that grabs all listings from stuerzer.de
* Use only capybara and poltergeist for this purpose
* Put all listings related information to hash like: {number: 8003382, manufacturer: Goldhofer, â€¦ etc} and show it in console
* Create mini library that helps you crawling similar sites


### For scrapping and get output on console follow below steps:

* Open command prompt and go to directory.
* Set proper ruby in rvm ( I have used ruby 2.2.2 but should work in other also)
* You should have 'capybara' and 'poltergeist' gem installed.
* Type 'ruby stuerzer_crawler.rb' in console.
